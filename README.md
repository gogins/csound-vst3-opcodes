This project provides plugin opcodes for hosting VST3 plugin instruments and effects in Csound.

These opcodes are a port of the existing vst4cs opcodes, which supports only the VST2 protocol, to the newer and more capable VST3 protocol.

These opcodes are designed to be cross-platform and to run at least on Linux, Windows, and OS X. Development is currently being done only on Linux.

csound-vst3-opcodes is non-commercial software and is licensed under GPLv3, as is the VST3 SDK; GPLv3, in turn, is compatible with Csound, which has a LGPLv2.1 license that permits relicensing to any later version of the GPL.
